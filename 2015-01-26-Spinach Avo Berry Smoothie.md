Perhaps some intro text here.
I was looking for a way to get my 4 year old to eat some greens. Found this simple and awesome way to make Spinach smoothie, takes 5 minutes  and everyone in the family including kids love it.

## Ingredients

  - A pack of fresh baby spinach leaves
  - A fresh orange
  - Half Avocado
  - Frozen mixed berries (ideally organic)
  - A spoon of sweetener like xylitol
  
## Directions
  - Open the baby spinach back and empty it into a blender (I prefer NutriBullet but any powerful blender should do.)
  - Peel the orange and chuck it into the blender as well.
  - Slice an avocado in half (if it's big) or use a full smaller one and spoon it out and put it in the blender.
  - Now add a handful or 2 of mixed berries.
  - Finally a spoon of xylitol (or sugar) or may be none, see how much sweetness you want.
  - Finally add some water.
  - Turn on the blender on full speed for a minutes.
  - Enjoy the smoothie.
  
How should we combine the ingredients to make the awesome recipe?
