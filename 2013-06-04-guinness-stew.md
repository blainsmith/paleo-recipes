A simple to make beef stew Irish style. This should make enough to feed 4-6 people depending on how much each person eats.

## Ingredients

- Beef cubes, around 500g
- 6 carrots
- 2 large onions
- 6 spring onions
- 1 can or bottle of Guinness
- 2 tbsp of gravy granules
- 2 beef stock cubes

## Directions

1. Peel your potatoes and carrots
2. Stick a pan on the hob with a drop of olive oil, when it gets hot throw in the beef cubes. Make sure you keep an eye on the beef while preparing the vegetables, stir it frequently and drain off any water that comes out
3. Chop the carrots, onions and spring onions and stick them in a large pot
4. Fill the pot with water and put it on a high heat
5. The beef should be done by now so chuch that into the pot too
6. When the mixture starts to bubble turn the heat down to just under medium and put in your gravy granules, beef stock, salt, pepper and 150ml of Guinness
7. Drink the rest of the guinness
8. After the big pot has been on for around an hour put your potatoes in a smaller pot and boil them
9. After the potatoes are cooked simply serve in wide bowls with brown bread or rolls

**Tip:** Some recipes tell you to cook your potatoes in the pot with the stew. You can do this but I only recommend it if you are planning on eating the entire thing in one serving. If you leave the potatoes in the stew overnight they will break up turing it into a soup. I always cook the potatoes in a separate pot and drain them so the leftovers are perfect to eat the following day for lunch.
